</b>                              In May 1900, Fidel Castro -- in an
                              effort to normalize relations with
                              the Carter Administration -- opened
                              the harbor at Mariel, Cuba with the
                              apparent intention of letting some
                              of his people join their relatives
                              in the United States. Within seventy-
                              two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed
                              for Cuba.   In the next few weeks, it
                              became evident that Castro was forcing
                              the boat owners to carry back with
                              them not only their relatives but the
                              dregs of his jail population. 3y the
                              time the port was closed 125,000
                              'Marielitos' had landed in Florida.
                              An estimated 25,000 had criminal
                              records.   This is the story of that
                              minority -- those they call 'Los
                              Bandidos.'

        for Manny.  "Later."

        He's in the middle of the "Boulevard" where a bustling black
        market in toiletries, clothing, cigarettes, and transves-
        tites is conducted nightly in the harsh glare of barrack
        neon.

        He ambles past a bunch of young guys throwing a Frisbee,

</b>            Tony,     five     minutes        later,        in   a   phone    booth, in    the    middle     of
  ._        a bank of them, dozens of Marielietos pressing to get in,
            trying     still      to        contact    somebody      --    anybody    --   on    the   outside.

            Tony is dialing, his eyes shifting down to the telephone
            number written in pencil on the back of a snapshot-   As he
            finishes the number, he flips the snapshot over and we see
            a young girl, about thirteen years old, dark, tiny, fiery,
            standing together with a dog and Tony, early twenties, in
            shadow, the fringes of the photo heavily tattered with
            handling.   Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone
            rings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we have
            not yet seen in Tony.
            Someone     picks      up        the     phone. An older woman's Voice.                    His
            expression         alters         to     uncertainty.

            Tony changes his mind, hangs up.  Pause. The faces of those
            in line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony
            ignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his
            pants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.
            He walks a few beats, his eyes pensive.                                 Then recognizes
            somebody     in       another          phone     booth   and     goes    over.

            Angel Frenandez has got the face of one, as he argues on
            the phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a
            worn phone book in his hand.

       She's standing there with a .32 pointed steady at him, the
       eyes like angry steel. There's no mistaking her ability to
       Shoot.


       The Toad pulls a 9mm out of the small of his back,
       approaches Tony.
       Angel is shoved into the room, followed by two more
       Columbians, "The Kids". They slam the door, both carrying
       Uzis with silencers, neither of them higher than five-four    (Xl

       cut across their blank eyes, they look like hungry little
       pirranha careless about killing, muttering with the Lizard

       Toad, completing the body search, rips out the stiletto
       taped to the small of Tony's back. As he mutters something
       in hard Columbian slang to the two kids who shove Angel
       into the bathroom, producing strands of thick rope.
       Even more worrisome is the chainsaw that the Lizard now
       pull6 out of the suitcase under the bed.  Toad begin6
       assembling it as Lizard, still covering Tonywith her gun,
       completes the deadpan process by turning up the volume on
       the television set. The news, not 50 ironically in Miami,
       is about a drug-related triple-homicide.

     nods and turns             on the whirring machine.

     shoots a surprised Lizard as she raises her pistol. She
     crashes backwards into the room, wounded.  Everything
     happens very fast now.
     Manny is        at   the lip           of     the bathroom,             he    fires       and    hits      kid
     one, who        is   turning,          in     the neck.

     Tony, not tied up yet, spins on kid two and smashes the
     unloosened strap across his face, sending him reeling
     across   the bathroom.
     The      Toad, chainsaw           in       hand,        slashes      at      Manny.

     Manny     now      spins    into       a    wall,       hit     in    the      side.

     The Lizard, wounded on her knees, is firing her .32 at
     him.   In b-g., the window simultaneously blows out as
     Chi-Chi appears firing a burst with his Ingram.
      In sharp f-g., the                 Lizard         crumples          forward        on    her        knees,
      foaming blood.

      Tony, with the tape still stuck across his mouth, smashes
      kid two, pinned against the blood-stained sink, with the
      stock of his own Ingram.

      In the midst of this, the Toad jumps up, wounded but with
                  strength, he tears out the motel room door
      hysterical
      gripping the whirring chainsaw in a reflex action.

     a knife out of nowhere, just missing Tony's gut by a half-
     second as Tony dances back, getting a grip on the machine
     pistol.

     He blows kid two away point-blank, putting another ten

hair, athletic body and a Copacabana tan, the clothes, a
casual polo shirt and the latest pants from Calvin Klein.

On his wrist is a flashy gold ID bracelet with "Alex'
written in diamonds and on the other wrist a gold Rolex
with a bezel full of diamonds worth maybe $30,000. His
eyes fizzle with an energy derived not from drugs but the
continual excitement of his toys and his money.
Accompanying him everywhere is the Shadow, a thin, intense
venomous-looking Hispanic man in his thirties, he has the
look of death in an unsmiling face.   He is always in
proximity to his Jefe, usually slightly behind the person
or persons addressing Sosa -- in a sort of garotte
position, his eyes swivelling to stare down the person who
might glance at him. He is a continual source of tension
underplaying the scenes, particularly coming to affect Omar
who is insecure to begin with.

     Sosa looks at him like that's obvious and moves on.   In his
     skinny  suit, with the wet cigarette clamped between his
     nervous fingers, Omar's not quite in his league with Sosa.

     Tow, awed by the scope of it all,               follows   along,   stops    to
     look at a sample of the dried coke.
     The      Shadow     stops,   eyeballs    him.

     Tony eyeballs him back, playing a game with him, then
     samples the coke off his thumb into his nose. Pause.                       His
     expression says I like it.   He moves on.

     just for a moment -- then continues towards Sosa with the

     Sosa lends his ear and the Skull whispers his information.
     A beat. He whispers a second thought. Sosa reacts minimally.
     Then he nods, dismissing the Skull who heads out the room.
     Sosa glances at his gold Rolex.

      Lights dimming to the bluesy rhythm of the Sinatra song as
      sad-eyed Octavia suddenly appears in the shifting spot-
      light drawing immediate laughter.
      He is dressed as an enormously fat old man with a Quasimodo
      mask covering both the front and back of his head and neck.
      With a red bulb for a nose, he gyrates grotesquely to the
      sleek song; once the mood of laughter has been established,
      the music suddenly shifts upbeat to "Saturday Night Fever"
      and the clown, like a butterfly from a worm, starts
      shedding the stuffing from his clothes, his big eyes
      staring out at us in theatrical melancholy.
      Tony watches, sitting alone, distracted by the clown.
      More laughter, more clothes coming off, building a tempo.
      PJ%en the head mask comes off, we see the gaunt handsome
      face of a young clown in white paint with the large
      blackened eyes staring without expression at the laughing
      audience.
      Tony is hooked by the image, looks on.
      The clown is down to his leotards, thin as a stick, and
      pulling the girls out onto the floor to dance with him,
      bouncing around like yo-yos. Everybody is laughing,
      everybody is merry...

                     law enforcement budget do you put a
                     dent in an estimated $100 billion a
                     year business? It seems at times
                     all you can do is put your finger in
                     the dike and pray but now we are
                     hearing voices that say the only way
                     we can solve the drug problem is the
                     same way Prohibition was solved.
                     Not by outlawing the substances but
                     by legalizing and taxing them.   These
                     voices say that will drive out the
                     organized crime element...

</b>      Tony and Nick The Pig get out of a van, frowning in the
      glary sunlight. From the continual sound of jet aircraft
      taking off and landing we might sense we're near an airport.
      As Nick hauls a duffel bag on his back, Tony, carrying a
      suitcase of his own, reads the sign on top of the warehouse:
<b>      "CONSOLIDATED CARRIES INC.

<b>160   INT. SEIDELBAUM OFFICE - WAREHOUSE - DAY                        16
</b>      The office is bare and ugly, the furniture naugahyde black.
      There's noise from an outer office, and people on phones,
      moving, talking.
      Tony and Nick sit on a couch stacking twenty dollar bills
      from the duffel bag and suitcase onto a coffee table.
      Two men in casual sports clothing sit opposite them in
      chairs, one of them -- Seidelbaum -- squaring the bills and
      passing them efficiently through a money-counting machine
      which clicks at rhythmic intervals throughout the scene.
      Seidelbaum's a small, fat 7th Avenue-type with a lot of
      rings on his fingers and sharp, porky eyes.
      The other guy -- Luis -- a dark Cuban, is long, lean and
      smooth with aquiline nose and dancing eyes. He drinks
      coffee, smiles a lot and bullshits -- two sordid guys who
      look the part.
      It's a tedious process counting a million five in twenties,
      it takes four/five hours; and throughout the desultory
      dialogue Tony, absorbed by the money, and Nick never stop
      the monotonous work of counting and stacking and noting the
                 At all times all four men, thoroughly aware of
      amounts.
      the large stacks on the table, move and talk gingerly
      although they appear casual and bored. They drink a lot of
      coffee.

              the bomb from the bag. With subtly inexorable music, the

              taped -- a malignant centipede in the long agile fingers of
              the Shadow, who delicately presses a tester. A glass

              the Shadow winds a roll of black tape from the bomb to an

      A young Columbian punk no more than twenty -- one of the

      He  doesn't hesitate, turning his machine gun on Gina.

      swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside.

                   here!
      Ernie suddenly wheels, hit in the face, by a burst of                    (X
      silencer bullets.
      We catch a brief glimpse of Sosa's black aide, the Skull,
      moving quickly along the wall of the house -- directly
      underneath the balcony on which Tony stands.

      Tony, tossing the empty machine gun aside, wildly runs back
      into his office to get more guns, crosses to Gina corpse.
      It takes him by surprise. He comes to a dead stop, kneels,
      looking questioningly in her face.

                       Hey     Gina come on, you still angry at
                       me?      I didn't mean to kill Manny, I
                       was..    .I   was.


      Running his hands along her face, trying to rouse her,
      gently lifting her eyelids.  Blood's running out of her
      mouth in rivers.

                Come on Gina, get off the floor.
                You're all dirty now, you need a
                bath.. .Mami's gonna be angry baby

                Come on open your eyes my baby,
                open your eyes.. -give me a smile.
      There's been a steady pounding and calling now on the door     (X:
      of the office. Tony finally hears it, looks up, then over
      at the monitors.
      One of them reveals Chi-Chi standing there outside the door
      pounding it.
<b>                                      CHI-CHI
</b>                Boss !    Hey boss.     Open up!
      On the monitor we see Chi-Chi suddenly spin and open fire
      down into the foyer. Return fire decimates him. A grenade
      goes off, blows him up against the door.
<b>                                      TONY
</b>                Cheeee!
      He now seems to come out of his catatonia, runs to his
      sideboard, hauls out a rocket shoulder-fired rocket
      launcher and straps an Uzi across his shoulder. He looks
      up at the monitor.
      On the monitors, the hitters are now darting across the
      foyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs.
      Three of them are already huddled outside the door, around
      the corpse of Chi-Chi, motioning to-each other, laying a
      grenade at the base of the door to blow it out.
      Tony loading his rocket, ihtends to beat them to the punch,
      talking to himself.

                 to my little friend here.
      Karroooomph!
      The rocket tears down the door and blows the Columbian
                                             It sounds like
      punks off the landing into the foyer.
      Armageddon, one of the hitters screaming, smoke billowing
      wildly.
      Tony, at the height of his mad glory, steps out at the apex
      of the stairs, firing his machine gun and yelling.

      A   hitter   tumbles   down    the     left-hand   stair.

           Another hitter tumbles down the right-hand stair.

           Left.    Right
           Another hitter   drops,   screaming, off the stairs into the
           pool below.
           A grenade goes off. Tony is hit again, but keeps on firing
           away.  Laughing like a madman.

                       to kill me!
           Behind him we see the remainder of the     pound of cocaine go
           up in a burst of wind, whipping around    the office in auras
           of white.  It is a ghostly effect out     of which now appears
           the face of the Skull moving from the     terrace towards    _
           Tony's back with a sawed-off shotgun.

                       ha ha ha ha!!
               Skull, now inches from Tony's back,     pulls   the   trigger
           The
           and blows Tony's spine out his belly.
           Tony crashes forward over the bannister into the interior
           swimming pool below.
           He floats quietly face down in the lit blue waters.
           As the titles begin their crawl up, the music theme is
           expressive salsa with a dash of gaiety.
           The camera moving off Tony to catch the reflection of the
           lit sculpture on the surface of the still waters.   It says:
<b>                              "THE WORLD IS YOURS"

                Our camera now distancing itself from the body in the pool,
                panning past the dream villa, past the shambles and the
                wealth, past the hitters pillaging and looting and drawing
                that obscene word "Chivato"    in   blood   on   the   outside   walls,
                past the stacks of cash blowing across the floor like
                leaves in autumn, with the looters running after it across
                the busted door with the tropic wind blowing down Coconut
                Grove -- to the Miami skyline across Biscayne Bay
